God only knows how I'm going to pull this off.

Luckily I've done this a couple times before. :-/

We'll need a game grid, I'm pretty sold on the hex version.

Raw game objects:
    Arena
    ArenaSlot
    Mob
    Player
    Skills (one per color)
    Talents
    Hoodoo
    Spell
    Effect

I need to draw.  Can't get away from it.

Hoodoo: An internal mechanic that does something.  With "chance", "pre", "post" phases.
Effect: An internal source of mechanic responses.  When it fires triggers, casts its own hoodoos. (As though a spell was being cast, because basically it is.)

Chance phase is both prevent and redirect.  If the chance phase ends in a redirect, you get another chance phase.  (No single hoodoo can fire more than once in a round.  A round begins with a top-level spellcast and ends when it is fully complete.  This should prevent recursion.)

Let's do.. mob/skills, arena, arena slot, then a spell.
