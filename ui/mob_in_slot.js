// Is there a good reason to do this outside of the arena_slot
// frame?  I mean, technically this gets rendered onto it
// And I can't think of a lot of other things that would go there
// instead.

// The answer to this was that the arena slot's rendering is
// all bound to its slot, not the mob or more importantly
// the mob's properties, which means a whole lot of stuff
// would have to be resubscribed, potentially abusing the
// renderer pattern.  No, this turned out to be a good idea.

// The second answer was that knockout knocks the socks off of
// Ice rendering and I'm migrating everything to it.  Ice is cool.
// Knockout is great.  Ice + Knockout is magic.
